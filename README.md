# GitUsersAngularApp

The aim of the project is to provide an interface to search for users on GitHub using the GitHub
REST API.
There would also be an option to sort users by their name alphabetically or based on their Rank.

As the user types into the search box on the top right, the profiles of users are fetched.

In the expanded view, show a list of users repositories.

The font used in the design is Lato. The search results list are paginated.
